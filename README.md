# Kickstarting-with-Excel
  ## 1: Overview of Project
  This analysis provides multiple ways of looking at success and failure within Kickstarter, specifically regarding theaters and plays.
  ## 2: Analysis and Challenges:
  - ### **Analysis**
   --While analyzing the kickstarter data, it was of utmost importance to isolate the most important factors, in this case the category and subcategory of interest (theaters and plays). A simple, powerful, and fast way of organizing large swaths of data can be accomplished through pivot tables, which is the primary means of organization utilized in sheet 2 of the workbook, ["Kickstarter Challenge"](main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx)
   - ### **Challenges** - *two major challenges*
      --The primary challenge was due to excel itself. While the excel suite has many powerful operations, formulas can be long and cumbersome, leading to fatigue and mistakes. For instance, Deleverable 2, "Outcomes Based on Goals" required the use of **countifs()** function, while simple to use, to find the correct information it required four unique commands (the correct subcategory, outcome, lower funding, upper funding). Off the top of my head, it seems as though a "between" function could remove one of the commands. 
      *I.E. (successful, play, betweeen 100 and 200), instead of (successful, play, above 100, AND below 200)
    Thus, there were many actions that were time consuming.
